jQueryMultipleSelectBox Feature Request

====================
1. submitField doesn't on page load
2. selectAllMultipleSelectBoxRows() doesn't work with maxLimit
3. work with jQuery UI
4. IE9 onmousemove doesn't be triggered when mouse out of the browser
5. Add search feature (popup input box, and then auto scroll to where you want)
